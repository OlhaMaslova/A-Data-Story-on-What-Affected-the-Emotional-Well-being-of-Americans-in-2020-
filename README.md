Term: Spring 2021

Project title: A "Data Story" on What Affected the Emotional Well-being of Americans in 2020? Did It Vary for Different Social Groups?

This project is conducted by Olha Maslova.

Project summary: 2020 was a difficult and stressful year for many people worldwide, and Americans are no exception. In this project, I am looking into what aspects of our life made us worry about things, causing additional stress and anxiety. For example:

How stressful do men and women find thinking about politics?
Do men and women have different levels of concern regarding the national economy and personal financial situation? What about different political groups?
How worried were men and women about getting the coronavirus (COVID-19)? What about different political groups?
How much have political differences hurt the relationships of people of different ages with their close family members and friends?
Is there a dependency between our income and being happy/worried about how things are going in the country?
