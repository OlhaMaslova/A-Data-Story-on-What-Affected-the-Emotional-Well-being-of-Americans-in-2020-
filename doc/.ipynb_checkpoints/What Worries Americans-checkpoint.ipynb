    "- personal finances and COVID-19 were a moderate concerns. \n",
    "- luckily, only a relatively small number of American families' relationships were hurt by the differences in their political views, so we couldn't draw a definite conclusion about whether/how it affected their well-being. \n",

    "### Women vs Men\n",
    "1. Women find politics more styressful than men. \n",
    "1. Women were less happy about how things are going in the country than men. Conversely, women seemed to worry about the state of the country more than men. \n",
    "1. The state of the national economy negatively affected women more than men.  \n",
    "1. Personal finances was a moderate concern for most men and women. \n",
    "1. Men and women were similarly concerned regarding contracting Covid-19. \n",
    "1. Differences in political views possibly hurt men's relationships with close family members and friends more than women's. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Age\n",
    "1. It seems like the relationships of younger people (50 y.o. or less) were hurt more than of those who are older.\n",
    "1. Older people seem to have their friendship relationships hurt more than the relationships with their family, which is the opposite for younger people.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Democrats vs Republicans vs Independent group\n",
    "1. Democrats were more worried about the state of the National Economy and contracting COVID-19 than any other political group.\n",
    "1. All groups were equally (moderately) worried about their personal finances.\n",
    "1. Relationships of both all parties were affected equally. \n",
